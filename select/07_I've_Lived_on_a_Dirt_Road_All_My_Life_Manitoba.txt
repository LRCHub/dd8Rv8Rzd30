Have i lost track of all the time?
Where i've been waiting by the phone
Tonight is colder than it was
And i just want to get you home
You felt so good you go out on
And lead your way back to the house
I slip my arm around your neck
And pull you over to the ground

Have i lost track of all the time?
Where i've been waiting by the phone
Tonight is colder than it was
And i just want to get you home
