Baby baby, baby baby
Baby baby, baby baby
Baby baby, baby baby
Ooh, I'm so glad

I will never find another lover
Sweeter than you, sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover
More precious than you, more precious than you

Girl, you are close to me just like my mother
Close to me just like my father
Close to me just like my sister
Close to me just like my brother
You are the only one, you're my everything
And for you this song I sing

And all my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

I said you're all that I'm thinkin' of, baby
Said I promised to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinkin' of, I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love, I cherish every hug
I really love you

And all my life I've prayed for someone like you
(So much baby baby!)
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me

You're all that I ever known
When you smile, on my face, all I see is a glow
You turned my life around
You picked me up when I was down

You're all that I ever known when you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down
You're all that I ever known when you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down

And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
